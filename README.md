## What's LearnLens All About?

Let's face it ‚Äì there's way too much to read online and not enough time to do it. That's where LearnLens comes in. We've built a Chrome extension that works like your personal research assistant, analyzing web pages to give you instant summaries, pull out the important stuff, and answer your specific questions about what you're reading.

Think of it as having a really smart friend who reads everything for you and tells you just what you need to know. No more information overload!

## How It Works
